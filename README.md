# Neural-Style-Transfer-GUI
A python app to transfer style from one image to another using pre-trained VGG19 CNN.

## Abstract
We use AI capable of image representations derived from convolutional neural networks optimized for working with image manipulation and can derive high-level information from these images. The AI part consists of a Neural Network Algorithm (VGG19 CNN) that can separate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The
algorithm allows us to produce new images of a high perceptual quality that combine the content of an arbitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous well-known
artworks thus allowing us to take centuries worth of learning in the art of various styles and categories and allow us to combine them to everyday modern images in very little time to generate new works that can produce stunning results.

We wrap this with a GUI that allows any user to tweak the parameters of the model, nad make adjustments to thee image.
